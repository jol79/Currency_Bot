Reqs: 
	1) Return the latest exchange rates.
	2) USD as base.
	3) The result should be printed in format of 2 decimal precisions.
	4) The data should be loaded to the database. In the next 10 min after user received a response the data will be stored in the database as "actual", for this purpose the field with TIMESTAMP will be used. 
	5) Exchange calculator. 
	6) Graph to show the trends for the selected currency.

	/list or /lst:
		The func: 
			Returns list of all available rates (e.g. DKK: 6.74
													  HUF: 299.56
													  ...: ...)
	/exchange:
		The func: 
			by selecting the currency that will be used to exchange and providing the value of that currency user will receive calculated value of that value to the USD.
	/graph:

Technologies that I will use:
	1) REST API to receive data from the server. 
	2) Matplotlib to build graphs.

Notes: 
	1) To send the graph to the user I can use file modules to store it and then send using telegram library function - send_photo()
